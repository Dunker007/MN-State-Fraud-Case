# Project CrossCheck 🏒

**Active Investigation: MN-DHS Case File #2025-X9**  
**Total Alleged Diversion: $9,000,000,000+**  
**Targets Identified: 19,419**

A public forensic dashboard exposing systemic fraud in Minnesota's Medicaid and social services programs.

### The Mission
Minnesota taxpayers lost billions to fraud while oversight failed. Project CrossCheck holds the chain of command accountable — from street-level providers to top administration — with open data, interactive visuals, and deep forensic intelligence.

## 🚀 Deep Intelligence System (New)

Project CrossCheck now employs advanced algorithms to detect fraud vectors that human auditors miss.

### 🦅 Phoenix Company Detector
- **Methodology**: Cross-references dissolved entity officers (MN Secretary of State) with new filings around program launches (e.g., Paid Leave).
- **Detection**: Identifies "Phoenix" companies—fraud rings that dissolve and rebrand to evade bans.
- **Accuracy**: Weighted scoring system considering dissolution reason, timing, and officer overlap.

### 🕸️ Provider Network Graph
- **Visualization**: Force-directed graph revealing hidden connections between providers.
- **Risk Clusters**: Automatically highlights "Incestuous Networks" (shared officers, addresses, bank accounts).
- **Metrics**: Calculates `Network Density` and `Centrality` scores for every entity.

### 📉 GDELT Sentiment Engine
- **Source**: GDELT Project DOC 2.0 (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone).
- **Analysis**: Real-time monitoring of media tone volatility concerning MN DHS.
- **Alerts**: Detects "Narrative Shifts" and correlation with major fraud indictments.

### 🎲 Monte Carlo Insolvency Simulator
- **Simulation**: Runs 10,000 scenarios using historical claim velocity and fraud prevalence.
- **Output**: Probability distribution of "Fund Insolvency Date" (e.g., "90% chance of bankruptcy by Q3 2026").
