# Project CrossCheck 🏒

**Active Investigation: MN-DHS Case File #2025-X9**  
**Total Alleged Diversion: $9,000,000,000+**  
**Targets Identified: 19,419**

A public forensic dashboard exposing systemic fraud in Minnesota's Medicaid and social services programs.

### The Mission
Minnesota taxpayers lost billions to fraud while oversight failed. Project CrossCheck holds the chain of command accountable — from street-level providers to top administration — with open data, interactive visuals, and live fraud news.

Inspired by Minnesota's aggressive hockey tradition: we **cross-check** the records so you don't have to.

### Key Features
- **Power Play Press** – Live fraud news feed powered by GDELT and the **Hunter Protocol**.
    - *Cycles through 4 phases hourly:*
    - **00-15m**: Targets (Walz, Ellison)
    - **15-30m**: Honey Pots (Daycare, Autism)
    - **30-45m**: Mechanisms (Ghost Employees)
    - **45-60m**: Spiderweb (RICO, FBI)
- **Penalty Box** – Force-directed network graph (high-risk nodes "serve time" with repulsion/glow)
